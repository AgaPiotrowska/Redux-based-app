Your favorite games App!
This is a React powered app built with the use of API in order to 
professional photographer website with built-in login page and API for the owner to upload photos and blog posts. I've used React-Router for navigation, Redux for managing the state and I've styled this application with the use of SASS. Website has been set up on AWS.

Motivation
I started this project to practise the use of Redux as well as to implement and fetch data from created API...

Content
Website consists of 6 sections.

Main page consists of carousel of best photos of the photographer as well as contact details and links to follow on social media.

Getting into navigation bar, we can select Portfolio Page where we have examples of different categories of photos - clicking on one of them will take us to the gallery page of certain album.

The next section called Migawki is a blog part of the webpage, where viewers can read interesting travel stories posted with photos of the author.

Video section presents video portfolio of the author. You can play video directly from the page.

In About Me section you will find a short story taking about author's motivations as well as contact details and contact form.

Section Realizations contains the list of author's last commercial projects. Each project has its own gallery with photos.

The last subpage Login is only accessed by the photographer - once logged in, thanks to API connected with .... admin can easily add or remove pictures in a chosen portfolio album, as well as add blog posts. The author has a full control on what's published on the webpage.
