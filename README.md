# Your favorite games App!
This is a React powered app built with the use of API in order to search for the games available on the market.
I have used React-Router for navigation, Redux for managing the state and I've styled this application with the use of styled components.

## Motivation
I started this project to practise the use of Redux as well as to call an API .  

## Content
Website consists of 3 sections:

**Upcoming games** is showing all the upcoming games that will be released in the next year. 

**New games** is showing all the new games that have been released last year until today. 

**Popular games** is showing all the popular games based on the rating. 

**Each section** is showing a box with game name, date of release and main picture. Once clicked on the box there is a new page opening with rating, platforms you can play the chosen game as well as pictures and description.

Navigation consists of the **search tool** to type in the certain game name that is interesting us.
